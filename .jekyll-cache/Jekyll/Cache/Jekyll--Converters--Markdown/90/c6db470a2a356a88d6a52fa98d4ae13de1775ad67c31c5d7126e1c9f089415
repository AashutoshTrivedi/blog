I"µ<p>Git is a open source version control system. Basically itâ€™s a software where we can manage and build the different versions of our software. It is a distributed service that contains history, edits, updates of the files.  GitHub on the other hand is a repository hosting service which is like a server that contains all our files and has git software installed on it.
<!--
Still difficult? Ok lets take an example why git is used and what makes it an integral part of the IT community. The typical software cycle involves a lot of steps like development, deployment, testing etc involving a large number of people working in collaboration. --></p>

<p>In this article weâ€™ll dive into two methods to initiate and work on a project locally and how to connect it remotely to a repository hosting service like GitHub or bit-bucket.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first method is by cloning an existing repo on github or any other hosting sote.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git clone https://examplerepo.org/something.git <span class="c">#creates a empty git repository in your local server</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will create a copy of a repo on your local pc where you can start changing the files.
Once we have done necessary changes and our files are ready we can add it back online using following commands.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git add <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="c">#adds all the files to the local index</span>
  git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"any comment here"</span>
  git push origin master <span class="c"># to push the changes to the master branch</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<hr />
<p>The  second method is to intitialize an emtpy git repo and then create a link online to github repo.
This can be done by</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git init <span class="c"># create an empty repo</span>
  git <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"# hello world"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> readme.md <span class="c"># create a readme files</span>
  git add <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="c"># adds into local</span>
  git remote add origin https://examplerepo.org/something.git
  git push <span class="nt">--set-upstream</span> origin master
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will push all the files to the master branch of the repository hosted online.</p>

<p>We can create a branch and push the changes as follows:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> brache1 <span class="c"># created a branch from master</span>
  git remote add origin https://examplerepo.org/something.git
  git push <span class="nt">--set-upstream</span> origin branch1
</code></pre></div></div>
